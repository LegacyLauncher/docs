# Industrial Craft 2
:::note[What's the issue?]
Addons for IC2 are often abandoned and not updated for the current version of the mod.
:::

## Installing a special patcher mod
The following mods can help you:
* [For Advanced Solar Panels](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-solar-panels-patcher)
* [For Advanced Machines](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-machines-patcher)

## Downgrading Industrial Craft 2
As far as we know, issues start occurring with Industrial Craft 2 version **2.8.191 or later**. Therefore, [older versions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-craft/files/2896786) should work.
