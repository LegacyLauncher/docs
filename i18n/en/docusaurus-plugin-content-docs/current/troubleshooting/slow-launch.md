# Launcher takes a long time to start

Your ISP (or antivirus) is probably blocking some of our repositories, or breaking your connection security check.

* Check your internet speed on SpeedTest. We recommend to choose a neighboring city or a server of another ISP. If the network access speed is too slow - we recommend to contact technical support of your ISP.
* Try changing DNS to `1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1` (CloudFlare) or `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4` (Google). Or any other, but preferably without filtering unwanted sites.

    :::
* Make sure that traffic filtering or domain scanning is disabled in your antivirus (DrWeb (SpiDer Gate function), ESET and Kaspersky are particularly affected by this).
