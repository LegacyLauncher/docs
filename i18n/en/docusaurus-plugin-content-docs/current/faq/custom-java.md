# Using custom Java versions
Legacy Launcher uses Mojang's recommended Java builds by Microsoft. This guide will help you to replace these Java versions with the ones of your choice.

6. Done! This Java version is customized, and can be freely modified or replaced
:::tip[Where I can get alternative Java distributions?]
You can download alternate Java distributions from their developers' websites, such as [Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre) and [Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/#downloads-table-zulu). *You should download the **archive**, not the installer*.

## Simplified method {#how-to-simplified}
Due to complaints about the stability of Mojang recommended Java builds we have prepared a ready-to-use package to replace Java with more stable ones.
1. Download the archive:
    * [For 32-bit Windows](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/xcXWahjDYbKqKg)
    * [For 64-bit Windows](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/6sEKgkJNeT90fA)
    :::note[Sources].
    Java versions for these archives are taken from open sources: [Adoptium Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre) (Java 8, Java 17) and [AdoptOpenJDK](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk16-binaries/) (Java 16)

2. Open the launcher settings, select "Minecraft" tab and go to Java settings
    ![Settings => Minecraft => Java => Java => "Customize"](./img/override-jre-ru-0.png).
3. In the window that opens, select the "Recommended" option
    ![Select "Recommended" Java](./img/override-jre-1.png)
4. Click "Open Folder"
    ![Open folder](./img/override-jre-2.png)
5. In the opened folder, **twice move up a level**.
    :::tip
    If you see folders named `java-runtime-alpha`, `java-runtime-beta`, `java-runtime-gamma`, `jre-legacy` then you have done everything correctly
    :::
    :::warning
    If you see the `.version` file next to a folder and/or don't see any other Java folders, or see `lib` and `bin` folders - you're probably in the wrong folder

6. Replace folder contents with the one from the downloaded archive.
7. Run the launcher and the game
